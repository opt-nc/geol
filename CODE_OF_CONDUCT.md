# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

## Outside Contributors

* **Discuss your intended changes** with the core team on Github, thanks to [discussions](https://github.com/opt-nc/geol/discussions)
* **Announce that you are working** or want to work on a specific issue
* **Avoid large pull requests**: they are much less likely to be merged as they are incredibly hard to review

  ## Pull Requests

* Do not commit/push directly to the main branch. Instead, create a fork and file a pull request, on `develop`
* When maintaining a branch, merge frequently with the main.
* When maintaining a branch, submit pull requests to the main frequently.
* If you are working on a bigger issue try to split it up into several smaller issues.
* Please do not open "Draft" pull requests. Rather, use issues or discussion topics to discuss whatever needs discussing.
* We reserve full and final discretion over whether or not we will merge a pull request. Adhering to these guidelines is not a complete guarantee that your pull request will be merged.

## Generative AI Policy

- **Please do not submit pull requests generated by AI (LLMs)**: reviewing such PRs put a considerable burden on the maintainers.
