# Persona 7: Richard, the Open-Source Contributor

- **Role:** An external developer or DevOps engineer who discovers and wants to use or improve `geol`.
- **Keywords:** Community, open-source, documentation, contribution, autonomy.
- **Key Quote:** *"Software should be freeâ€”free to inspect, modify, and share. A good project makes this easy."*

---

### CLI Expectations
- **Well-structured Code:** The code should be idiomatic, commented where necessary, and easy to navigate.
- **Simple Build Process:** A new contributor should be able to clone the repo and run tests with one or two simple commands.
- **Good Documentation:** Both in the code and in markdown files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

### Goals
- **Understand quickly:** Grasp the tool's value proposition and how it works in a few minutes.
- **Install and use easily:** Follow clear instructions to get a working tool quickly.
- **Contribute effectively:** If he likes the tool, he wants to be able to fix a bug or add a feature without spending hours understanding the code.

### User Stories
- **As Richard,** I want to find a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file that explains the project's coding standards and PR process so I can contribute effectively.
- **As Richard,** I want to run the entire test suite with a single command (e.g., `task test`) to validate my changes before submitting a PR.
- **As Richard,** I want to easily add support for a new product by following the existing architecture and code patterns.
