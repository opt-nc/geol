### CLI Expectations
- **N/A:** He will never use the CLI directly.
- **Aggregatable Data:** The data produced by the tool must be easy to aggregate and visualize for high-level dashboards.

### Goals
- **Get a high-level overview:** Understand the overall health of the application landscape and infrastructure.
- **Optimize costs:** Allocate budgets effectively between new projects and maintaining existing ones.
- **Ensure team productivity:** Make sure technical teams have the right tools and processes.

### Frustrations
- The lack of clear and concise dashboards for decision-making.
- Technical projects that seem to never end and bring no visible business value.
- Technical risks (security, stability) that can turn into major business problems.

### User Stories
- **As Gordon,** I want a dashboard showing the percentage of our tech stack that is at risk due to EOL, so I can justify the budget for modernization projects.
- **As Gordon,** I want to track our technical debt over time to ensure we are actively managing obsolescence.
- **As Gordon,** I want to compare different business units based on their "obsolescence score" to identify areas needing strategic investment.
