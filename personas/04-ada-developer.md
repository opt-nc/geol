# `Developer`: Ada, the Developer

- **Role:** Designs and develops product features.
- **Keywords:** Creativity, speed, simplicity, feedback.
- **Key Quote:** *"Just let me code. I want a tool that helps me, not one that slows me down with complex configuration."*

---

### CLI Expectations
- **Great Help:** A clear, comprehensive, and easy-to-read `help` command.
- **Useful Error Messages:** Errors should be explicit and, whenever possible, suggest a solution.
- **Shell Auto-Completion:** Would be a huge productivity boost.
- **Human-Readable by Default:** The default output should be interactive and easy on the eyes.

### Goals
- **Build features quickly:** Have a smooth and frictionless development cycle.
- **Test her code easily:** Launch a local development environment and deploy to test environments effortlessly.
- **Understand the execution environment:** Easily access logs and information about her application's status.

### Frustrations
- The infamous "it works on my machine" but fails in production.
- Long and complex deployment processes that break her workflow.
- Having to wait for help from a DevOps or SysAdmin to get simple information.

### User Stories
- **As Ada,** I want to quickly check if the framework version I'm about to use is actively supported so I don't build on a dead-end technology.
- **As Ada,** I want the CLI to tell me if I made a typo in a product name and suggest the correct one.
- **As Ada,** I want to explore all checkable products with a simple `list` command to understand the tool's capabilities.
