# Personas

This directory contains the descriptions of the personas used for the design and development of the `geol` CLI.

Personas are user archetypes that represent the different roles, goals, and frustrations of the people who will interact with our tool, directly or indirectly.

## Why use personas?

1.  **User-Centered Design:** They help us make design decisions (UX, features, command phrasing) by putting ourselves in the end-user's shoes.
2.  **Prioritization:** They allow us to prioritize features based on the value they bring to each persona.
3.  **Communication:** They provide a common language for the entire team (developers, project managers, etc.) to talk about users.

Each file in this directory describes a specific persona.
