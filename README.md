# ❔ About

`geol` is a Go based alternative to the famous [`hugovk/norwegianblue`](https://github.com/hugovk/norwegianblue) python
based `cli`.

Its ambitions are to : 

1. Deliver a at least UX as good as `hugovk/norwegianblue` aka. `geol` does,
2. First class terminal based UX
3. Make delivery easier and safer
4. Enhance with new custom awaited features
5. Create innovative ways to manager EOLs for more security, for all

# 🚀 QuickStart

To install:

- **Manually**: Go to the [releases](https://github.com/opt-nc/geol/releases) page and download the version corresponding to your operating system
- **Automatic**: Install via `brew` see [homebrew-tap](https://github.com/opt-nc/homebrew-tap)

1. Install `geol`

With `brew`:

```sh
brew install --cask opt-nc/homebrew-tap/geol
```

Or simply with `go`:

```sh
go install github.com/opt-nc/geol@latest
```

2. Update:

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade --cask
geol version
```

## Autocompletion

If the autocompletion is not working yet, you need to update your fpath.

For `zsh` you need to add the following lines to your `.zshrc` file : 

```sh
# === Homebrew completions ===
# Add Homebrew completions to fpath
fpath=(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)

# Activate Homebrew completions
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

# (Optional) Disable the warning of duplicate completions
zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes
```

Then restart your terminal or source your `.zshrc` file : 

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## 🧑‍💻 Documentation

You can access the help either by using the `help` subcommand or with the man page.

```sh
geol help
man geol
```

## 🤓 Build it yourself

To build it youself : 

```sh
go build -o geol ./cmd/geol
```
